      <p>
          My name is Isis Black. I am a rising third-year computer science major and student-athlete at Hampton University.
          I am from Stafford, Vriginia where I am currently working remotely as a Google STEP Intern. I started coding two years ago
          as a freshman in college and I really enjoy it. Growing up I have always loved art and sports as well. I started playing
          volleyball my freshman year of high school, and I eventually earned a full-ride scholarship to college where I get to
          learn and develop my skills every day. <br/>
          <br/>
          I have been very into fashion lately and have been doing a lot of secondhand shopping. I enjoy the art of styling and have
          been planning on building my own shop through a selling app soon. As mentioned earlier, I love art and have been drawing
          since I was in third grade. Referencing and creating works is one of my passions.<br/>
          <br/>
          Since both of my parents were in the Marine Corps I have been able to live in a few different places. I was born in Japan 
          and have lived in Hawaii and Virginiaâ€”twice! Growing up I found that I really enjoy traveling and I love learning about 
          and meeting new people. I hope I get to visit all of the places I have ever wanted to go to in my lifetime!
